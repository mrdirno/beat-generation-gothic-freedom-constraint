## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a 'found document' from Alma's archive: a grocery list, a diary entry, or a faded photograph with a cryptic caption that hints at a forgotten history of Séjourne.
- Create a character who is a 'living record'—a busker on Royal Street whose songs accidentally reveal other people's memories, or a bartender who serves 'tonics' that induce specific, curated forgetfulness.
- Draft a scene where a minor character from the novel (Mr. Leoni, the editor, the toppled angel) encounters a 'beat'—a moment of raw, arrhythmic truth—and describe how it changes them.
- Imagine a 'prequel' vignette showing the fire at the jazz club on Rampart, told from the perspective of the saxophone that survived, its brass still warm with the last note played.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Gothic Atmosphere Generator' that combines sensory details (smell of ozone & old books, sound of a broken bell, texture of peeling paint) with Southern Gothic archetypes to create instant setting prompts.
- Develop a 'Constrained Writing' web tool where users must write a 500-word story using only words from the novel's first chapter, exploring how limitation breeds creative freedom.
